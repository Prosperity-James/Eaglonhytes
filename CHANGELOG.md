## [1.x.x] - Previous Versions

### Previous Features

- User registration and authentication
- Land application system
- Contact message system
- Image upload functionality
- Admin dashboard (single role)

---

## Migration Notes

### From 1.x to 2.0.0
1. **Database Migration Required**: Run `database/add_role_system_safe.sql`
2. **Logout Required**: All users must logout and login again to get role assigned
3. **Backward Compatible**: Existing `is_admin` flag still works
4. **Default Role**: All new registrations default to `role = 'user'`

### Breaking Changes
- Admin users must be explicitly created by Super Admin (no public admin registration)
- Users API now filters based on role
- Admin dashboard split into two separate components
