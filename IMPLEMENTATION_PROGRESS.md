# Role Separation Implementation Progress

## ✅ COMPLETED STEPS

### 1. Database Migration
- ✅ Created `add_role_system.sql` migration script
- ✅ Added `role` column (ENUM: super_admin, admin, user)
- ✅ Added `created_by` column to lands table
- ✅ Created `admin_audit_log` table for tracking admin actions
- ✅ Added indexes for performance

**To Run:**
```bash
mysql -u root eaglonhytes < database/add_role_system.sql
```

### 2. Backend Authentication Middleware
- ✅ Created `auth_middleware.php` with role-based functions:
  - `requireAuth()` - Check if user is logged in
  - `requireRole($roles)` - Check specific role(s)
  - `requireSuperAdmin()` - Super admin only
  - `requireAdmin()` - Admin or Super admin
  - `canPerformAction()` - Check permissions for specific actions
  - `logAdminAction()` - Audit trail logging
  - `filterUsersByRole()` - Filter user lists based on viewer role
  - `canModifyUser()` - Check if user can be modified

### 3. Updated Backend APIs
- ✅ **login.php** - Now includes `role` in session
- ✅ **session.php** - Returns `role` with user data
- ✅ **users.php** - Filters users based on role:
  - Super Admin: Sees all users (including admins)
  - Admin: Only sees regular users
  - Logs all view actions
- ✅ **create_admin.php** - NEW endpoint for Super Admin to create admins

### 4. Role-Based Permissions Implemented

#### Super Admin Can:
- ✅ View ALL users (including admins)
- ✅ Create new admin accounts
- ✅ Edit/delete any user
- ✅ Full land management
- ✅ View revenue reports
- ✅ Access system settings
- ✅ Export data
- ✅ Delete messages
- ✅ View audit logs

#### Admin Can:
- ✅ View regular users ONLY (not other admins)
- ✅ Edit land status and images
- ✅ Manage applications (approve/reject)
- ✅ View and reply to messages (cannot delete)
- ❌ Cannot create admins
- ❌ Cannot view revenue reports
- ❌ Cannot export data
- ❌ Cannot access system settings
- ❌ Cannot see other admins

#### Regular User Can:
- ✅ Browse properties
- ✅ Submit applications
- ✅ View own applications
- ✅ Update own profile

## 🚧 IN PROGRESS

### 5. Frontend Updates (Next Steps)

#### A. Rename Current Dashboard
- Rename `AdminDashboard.jsx` to `SuperAdminDashboard.jsx`
- Keep all current features (full access)

#### B. Create New Admin Dashboard
- Create `AdminDashboard.jsx` with limited features:
  - ❌ Remove "Create Admin" button
  - ❌ Remove "Users" tab (show only customers)
  - ❌ Remove "Reports" tab (no revenue reports)
  - ❌ Remove "Settings" tab
  - ❌ Remove export buttons
  - ✅ Keep Lands tab (edit only)
  - ✅ Keep Applications tab
  - ✅ Keep Messages tab (no delete)

#### C. Update App Routing
- Route based on user role:
  - `role === 'super_admin'` → SuperAdminDashboard
  - `role === 'admin'` → AdminDashboard
  - `role === 'user'` → Regular user pages

#### D. Update AuthContext
- Add `role` to user state
- Update login/session to include role

#### E. Create Admin Management UI (Super Admin Only)
- Add "Create Admin" button in Users tab
- Create admin form modal
- List admins separately from regular users

## 🔐 Security Features Implemented

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - Middleware enforces permissions at API level
   - Frontend hides features user cannot access
   - Backend always validates regardless of frontend

2. **Audit Trail**
   - All admin actions logged to `admin_audit_log` table
   - Tracks: who, what, when, where (IP)
   - Immutable log for compliance

3. **Super Admin Protection**
   - Cannot be deleted
   - Cannot be demoted
   - Hidden from admin user lists
   - Email cannot be changed by others

4. **User List Filtering**
   - Admins never see other admins
   - Super admin excluded from admin views
   - Prevents unauthorized access attempts

## 🎯 Next Immediate Steps

1. **Run Database Migration**
   ```bash
   mysql -u root eaglonhytes < database/add_role_system.sql
   ```

2. **Verify Super Admin Account**
   - Check that admin@eaglonhytes.com has role='super_admin'

3. **Continue with Frontend Implementation**
   - Update AuthContext
   - Create two separate dashboards
   - Implement role-based routing

## 📝 Notes

- All backend changes are backward compatible
- Existing sessions will need to re-login to get role
- Migration is safe and reversible
- Audit log provides full accountability

**Status: Backend Complete ✅ | Frontend In Progress 🚧**
