# Role Separation Proposal: Super Admin vs Admin

## Current System Analysis

Currently, the application has:
- **Users Table**: Contains both regular users and admins (identified by `is_admin` boolean)
- **Public Registration**: Anyone can register as a regular user
- **Single Admin Dashboard**: All admins see the same dashboard with full access

-- Update existing admin to super_admin
UPDATE users SET role = 'super_admin' WHERE email = 'admin@eaglonhytes.com';

-- Add created_by column to lands table (track who created each land)
ALTER TABLE lands ADD COLUMN created_by INT AFTER featured;
ALTER TABLE lands ADD FOREIGN KEY (created_by) REFERENCES users(id);
```

### 2. Backend Changes
- ✅ Update `register.php` - Remove public admin registration
- ✅ Create `create_admin.php` - Super Admin only endpoint
- ✅ Update `users.php` - Filter users based on role
- ✅ Update `lands.php` - Add created_by tracking
- ✅ Create middleware for role-based access control

### 3. Frontend Changes

- ✅ Create `AdminDashboard.jsx` - Limited access dashboard
- ✅ Update navigation based on user role
- ✅ Hide/show features based on permissions
- ✅ Add "Create Admin" button for Super Admin only

### 4. Registration Flow
- ❌ Remove admin registration from public signup
